# Predicting-failure-of-Turbofan-using-LSTM

This project aims to predict the failure of an engine in a Turbofan during a particular time frame. In this project, I have implemented a LSTM model to predict whether a particular engine of the Turbofan will fail within the next 30 days. 

# Purpose of the project

Maintaining a complex machine is a very tedious task. It involves a lot of manpower and a lot of costs are involved to replace/repair the machine after it has failed to work. For example, if the machine fails today, it might take a few hours/days for the plant users to identify the mistake and repair the machine. When the machine stops working the production is stopped and this is a waste of time. Therefore, if we are able to predict when the machine might fail, then the respective plant workers will take precautionary measures and get ready to fix it as soon as possible. These models will help to increase the productivity during a failure by reducing the time to repair.

# Results

Overall, this project achieved an accuracy of 98.89%. Below is the snapshot of the probability that the engine number 14 will fail within the next 30 days. It is seen that there is a 11% probability that the machine will fail. Plant users may need to be precautionary when the probability is more than 50%.
